# Claude session notes

This file is for future Claude sessions on this repo. The human (Mike) doesn't read it. Keep it terse, practical, and up-to-date with anything that bit you.

If you're starting fresh: read this top-to-bottom before touching code. Then read `docs/MUSEUM_UX.md` for current direction.

---

## Canonical museum vocabulary

Before any work that touches museum tag vocabulary, pill columns, or artifact categorization, read `docs/CANONICAL_VOCABULARY.md`. The canonical vocabulary is the operator's locked design from April 2026. Specs in `docs/deep-dive-review/` describe architecture; they do not define vocabulary. Vocabulary inventions in spec sessions have been a repeated Ops failure mode — the canonical doc is authority.

## What this repo is

Weird.Baby Museum — a Vite + React + React Router site, deployed via Cloudflare Workers. The frontend is a "museum" with multiple artists/sections. Hunter Root (HR) is the primary artist content currently built out.

The "exhibit" surface (album coverflow + tracklist + video player + filter deck) lives at `/hr` and is the most active area for UX work.

MediaVault is now under local-only git at `C:\AI\Platform\MediaVault\.git` (initialized 2026-05-08). Three commits as of init, branch `master`, no remote ever planned. See MediaVault's `STATE.md` "Version control" section and `CHANGELOG.md` for current state.

### Data model — albums and tracks

Three parallel representations of the same data. Mike calls these "variants" (which is overloaded with the music-variant taxonomy below — context disambiguates).

1. **`SPINE` in `src/data/artists/hunter-root.js`** — canonical. Each album: `{ id, title, year, art, accent, tracks: [{ title, videos: [{ ytId, label, type, credit? }] }] }`.
2. **`ALBUMS` in `src/routes/hr/HrArchive.jsx`** — title-only mirror. `tracks: ["Title 1", "Title 2", ...]`.
3. **`HR_ALBUM_OPTIONS` and `HR_SONG_OPTIONS` in `src/routes/hr/hr_dimensions.js`** — slug/label vocabulary for filter pills.

When you change the spine, mirror the change in #2 and verify #3 still covers all unique track titles. `hr_facts.js` references tracks by exact `albumId` + `trackId` (== `title`) — don't rename a title without checking facts.

### Track media variant taxonomy

Per Mike (settled May 2026): variants are **Official / Live / Lyrics / Cover**. **Clips don't belong in tracklists** — drop them, don't tag them. The `type` field on each video is one of `"official" | "live" | "lyrics" | "cover"`.

There used to be `"clip"` entries; they're gone as of merge `e4ea01b`.

## Design tokens

Single canonical gold across the codebase. JS constants in `HrExhibitFlow.jsx`:

| Constant | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `INK` | `#080808` | Section background |
| `INK_SOFT` | `#0d0d0d` | Active tab / pill fill, "raised card" |
| `INK_CARD`, `INK_CARD_HI` | `#0a0a0a`, `#0e0e0e` | Card backgrounds |
| `BORDER` | `#1a1a1a` | Pill default border |
| `BORDER_HI` | `#252525` | Zero-count pill text |
| `GOLD` / `GOLD_HI` / `GOLD_LO` / `DIM` | all `#b8974a` | Canonical gold (consolidated; comments preserve the cream-→-gold history) |
| `GOLD_MUTE` | `#555` | Disabled / muted controls |

Inline-styled "less bright gold" values: `#6a5520` (deck pill unselected), `#7a7a7a` (tracklist tag unselected). When in doubt, prefer one of these instead of inventing new shades.

## Exhibit deck — non-obvious behaviors

These are the cumulative result of the May-2026 UX iterations. Reading the JSX without this context will mislead.

- **Tab strip is `position: fixed`** (in `S.deck`), not absolute-in-section. It pins to the viewport bottom, not to `.hr-section-deck-host`. This is to escape `.hr-section`'s `scroll-snap-align: center` which centers the section with a 32px gap above/below.
- **Player bar lift** is conditional via CSS `body:has(.pb) .hr-deck { bottom: 60px; }`. The default is `bottom: 0`. PlayerBar (Exhibit.jsx) returns null when no video plays, so `.pb` leaves the DOM and the deck slides back down.
- **Active tab merges with deck-body** via a 1px-tall `INK_SOFT` cover element (positioned `left:-1, right:-1, bottom:-1` inside the active tab when `open && active`) that overlays the deck-body's `border-top: 1px solid var(--hr-gold-lo)`.
- **`TAB_PEEK = TAB_STRIP_H = 30`** — the closed and hover-peek states render identically. Originally `TAB_PEEK=14` for a "tab tops only" peek effect, but at 30px tab height the labels get clipped mid-glyph. Pinned to full strip.
- **Pill semantics**: a column with **zero selections** is treated as "all selected" (no filter). Pills render in `GOLD_HI` with **transparent border**. Selecting any one pill flips the others to dim+border to indicate an explicit filter. This is the `noneSelected` prop threaded `PillGroupColumn → PillButton → S.pill / S.pillCount`.
- **Pill count color matches label color** in every state. Don't break this.
- **Tracklist variants are radio buttons** — only one variant active per track. Click an active variant to deselect to empty. (Was multi-select Set semantics pre-`f01ee88`.)
- **Per-tab clear `✕`** — small `✕` in each tab's top-right corner. Always rendered. Dim+unclickable when `tabHasSelection(tab)` is false; brighter+pointer when true. The strip-level "clear all" button no longer exists. The original `clear()` whole-deck reset is preserved with `eslint-disable-next-line` comment for potential revival.
- **AuditStrip is dev-only and intentionally not rendered** — was at z-index 9999 bottom-right and occluded the player bar's controls. The function is preserved in `HrExhibitFlow.jsx` for revival; the JSX render call is removed.

## Release discipline

1. Testing happens in a sandbox, not on the live Museum.
2. Features reach the Museum only after sandbox validation.
3. Releases to main happen only when Ops needs human testing.
   Not for morale. Not for "let's see it working." Operator-confirmed only.

## Workflow

Mike develops on Windows; you usually run inside a Cowork Linux sandbox. The split:

- **You make edits + commits in the cowork sandbox.** Files write to disk via the FUSE mount → Mike's actual repo.
- **Mike pushes from PowerShell.** You can't push from the sandbox (no GitHub credentials).
- **You drive Chrome to open the PR.** Mike has the GitHub tab open; you navigate, fill the title and body, click Create, then Squash and merge, Confirm, Delete branch.
- **Mike runs the local cleanup** (checkout main, pull, branch -d).

Mike pre-approves the entire flow when he says "push" — drive end-to-end without re-asking for each click.

### Conventions

- **Branch naming**: hyphenated (e.g. `ux-exhibit-tweaks-2`). **Slashed names like `ux/foo` fail in the cowork sandbox** — the FUSE mount can't create subdirectories under `.git/refs/heads/`. Always use hyphens.
- **Commit author from cowork**: `cowork agent <cowork@local>`. GitHub overrides this on squash-merge to Mike's noreply (`98126530+langmikea@users.noreply.github.com`), so the squash commit on `main` is correctly authored.
- **Commit messages**: subject line under 72 chars, imperative mood. Body explains *why* and references the user's report verbatim where applicable.
- **PR bodies**: tabular fix summary, commit list, mechanism notes, "out of scope" section. Include the literal user-reported phrasing.
- **Squash merge** is the default — most branches accumulate iteration commits. Only choose merge-commit if the per-commit history is genuinely worth preserving.

### Pre-flight before commit

1. Verify file integrity: `wc -c <file>` matches expected, `tail -3 <file>` shows the proper end.
2. `npm run lint` — should be at the baseline (currently **4 errors / 6 warnings**, all pre-existing on main, all in routing files Mike has flagged for separate semantic review). If your number is higher, you've introduced an error.
3. `npm run build` — must pass. Vite + rolldown + Cloudflare plugin.

## Local tooling

`tools/Get-ProjectStatus.ps1` is a PowerShell helper that reads the current repo state and prints a recommended next step — git branch/ahead/behind/uncommitted counts, the next unchecked task in `TODO.md`/`NEXT.md` if present, detected manifests (Node, Python, etc.), and the five most recently modified files. Run it from the repo root: `.\tools\Get-ProjectStatus.ps1`. On a fresh Windows clone the script may be flagged as downloaded-from-web by SmartScreen — run `Unblock-File .\tools\Get-ProjectStatus.ps1` once to clear the zone-identifier ADS, then it executes normally.

### Deep Dive export

`npm run export-artifacts` reads released artifacts from MediaVault (`http://127.0.0.1:51822/db`) and writes per-exhibit JSON to `src/data/exhibits/<name>.json` (one file per `exhibit:` tag value). The museum imports these files statically at build time. MV must be running on the operator's laptop; the script won't work from CI or another machine.

Use `--dry-run` to see what would be exported without writing. Use `--verbose` to see the SQL query and per-card details.

### Release flow

To publish newly-released MV artifacts to weird.baby, run these in order:

1. **In MV**: flip artifact status to `released` via inbox triage.
2. **In museum repo**: `npm run export-artifacts` — regenerates `src/data/exhibits/hunter_root.json` from MV's current released set. (MV must be running; see Deep Dive export above.)
3. **In museum repo**: commit the refreshed snapshot:
   ```bash
   git add src/data/exhibits/hunter_root.json src/data/vocabulary.json
   git commit -m "data: regen hunter_root.json"
   ```
4. **In museum repo**: `npm run deploy` — builds and ships to weird.baby.

**Step 2 is the most-missed step.** `npm run deploy` runs `vite build && wrangler deploy`; it does NOT regenerate the JSON from MV. Skipping step 2 ships a stale snapshot — visitors see yesterday's released set, not today's. The "released video didn't show up" symptom of 2026-05-25 was exactly this: 36 newly-released YT artifacts got triaged into MV but `export-artifacts` was skipped, so the SPA bundle still carried the prior export's 19-artifact JSON.

Long-term: HR acquisition tooling (T8, audit §6.4) will auto-emit `exhibit:hunter_root` at capture time, removing the manual exhibit-tag step. The 4-step release flow above stays the same.

### Cross-platform native dependencies

Any npm package with a native compiled component (currently `better-sqlite3`) requires `prebuild-install` in `devDependencies` so the operator's machine can fetch pre-built binaries on install without needing Visual Studio Build Tools. The cowork sandbox builds for Linux; Mike's Windows machine needs its own platform-specific binary. If a "not a valid Win32 application" error appears at runtime on Windows, `npm rebuild <package-name>` is the local fix on the operator's side.

## Cowork sandbox quirks (READ THIS)

The FUSE mount has multiple defects that cost real time. Work around them:

1. **`Edit` tool truncates files.** When you call Edit on an existing file, the FUSE mount preserves the original byte count and pads/truncates. If your edit makes the file longer, content from the end gets clipped. **Mitigation**: always `tail -3` and `wc -c` after an Edit. For non-trivial edits, use a Python `rm + write` pattern via `mcp__workspace__bash`:
   ```python
   with open(path, 'rb') as f: data = f.read()
   data = data.replace(old, new, 1)
   os.remove(path)
   with open(path, 'wb') as f: f.write(data)
   ```

   Related manifestation: bash views of files in the FUSE mount may show truncated content even when the `Read` tool sees full content for the same path — the host-side (Windows) file is usually intact, the bash view is the unreliable one. When pre-flighting (`wc -c`, `tail -3`) the file looks wrong via bash, cross-check via the `Read` tool before assuming the file on disk is broken. Verified at PR #14 (Phase 3 session, 2026-05-10): `CLAUDE.md` read fine via Read but bash `tail -3` cut off mid-word; on-disk content was intact. When this hits, don't read-modify-write via Python — construct fresh content from the Read-tool view and write-only via the rm+write pattern.

2. **CRLF line endings.** Files on Windows disk are CRLF; the FUSE mount preserves them. `sed` and Python regex matching needs to handle both LF and CRLF. Pattern:
   ```python
   if old_b in data: data = data.replace(old_b, new_b)
   elif old_b.replace(b'\n', b'\r\n') in data: data = data.replace(...)
   ```

3. **`rm` requires explicit permission**. First call `mcp__cowork__allow_cowork_file_delete(path)` once per session — Mike approves a directory and then deletes work for the rest of the session. Without it, `rm`, `git stash`, `git checkout -b` (any op that creates and removes lock files) fail with "Operation not permitted". Scope the request narrowly the first time. Asking for delete permission on a whole project tree (e.g. `MediaVault/`) will be rejected; asking for the specific subdirectory the work needs (e.g. `MediaVault/.git/`) will be approved. State explicitly in the request that no user files will be touched. Re-requesting after a rejection wastes a round trip.

4. **Slashed branch names fail** (see above). The sandbox can't `mkdir` under `.git/refs/heads/`.

5. **Build needs a manual symlink.** The rolldown native binary is nested wrong for Linux. The lookup path is `node_modules/rolldown/dist/rolldown-binding.linux-x64-gnu.node` (one directory level deeper than `node_modules/rolldown/`):
   ```bash
   ln -sf ../../@rolldown/binding-linux-x64-gnu/rolldown-binding.linux-x64-gnu.node \
     node_modules/rolldown/dist/rolldown-binding.linux-x64-gnu.node
   ```
   Run this before `npm run build` if you're getting `Cannot find module '../rolldown-binding.linux-x64-gnu.node'`. The symlink is gitignored and harmless on Mike's Windows side. Verified at PR #14 (Phase 3 session, 2026-05-10) — earlier path documentation was off by one directory level. The exact target path may rotate (the `.binding-linux-x64-gnu-<hash>` suffix is content-addressed and changes when rolldown updates); locate first with `find node_modules -name 'rolldown-binding*linux*' -not -type l` and symlink to the heaviest non-symlink hit. Verified again 2026-05-25 (T3 session).

6. **Sandbox `git status` can desync after heavy activity.** If you see "No commits yet" or every file as "new", the sandbox view is broken — Mike's actual git state on disk is fine. Verify by asking Mike to run `git status` in PowerShell, or by using the `Read` tool (which reads the Windows path directly, separate from the FUSE git view).

7. **CRLF false positives in `git status`.** On a freshly-mounted repo, `git status` may show every routing-file CSS/JSX as `M` due to CRLF round-tripping through FUSE. Verify with `git diff --ignore-cr-at-eol --stat`; if empty, it's noise — proceed with explicit `git add` paths to keep the noise out of your commit.

8. **FUSE mangles git's internal files — multiple symptoms across multiple triggers.** Originally discovered 2026-05-08 during MediaVault `git init`; further manifestations surfaced at PR #14 (2026-05-10) during normal session work. The common root cause is the same as quirk #1 (FUSE byte-preservation / truncation), but applied to git's atomic `.lock`-rename writes rather than the Edit tool. The trigger is not only `git init` — it can fire on session mount and on any git operation that rewrites internal files atomically (`git stash`, branch ops, etc.).

   Known manifestations:
   - **`.git/config` written as null bytes** (54 bytes of `\x00`) from bash's view on a fresh `git init`, while the host-side filesystem shows partial valid content. Fix: rewrite `.git/config` via the rm+write Python pattern from quirk #1.
   - **`.git/objects/` missing entirely** after `git init`. Without it, `git status` reports "not a git repository." Subdirectories `info/` and `pack/` are also missing. Fix: `mkdir -p .git/objects/info .git/objects/pack`.
   - **`.git/HEAD` arriving with trailing null bytes on session mount** (e.g. 34 bytes instead of 21, with `\x00` padding after `ref: refs/heads/main\n`). Symptom: `git rev-parse HEAD` errors with "Failed to resolve HEAD as a valid ref" / "ambiguous argument 'HEAD'"; `git status` may also error. Fix: rm+write Python pattern with a clean `ref: refs/heads/main\n` (21 bytes).
   - **`.git/index` corrupted by `git stash` (or other atomic-rewrite ops)**. Symptom: "bad signature 0x00000000" or "index file corrupt". Fix: `rm .git/index && git read-tree HEAD` to rebuild the index from the committed tree. No working-tree changes are lost — `git read-tree HEAD` only rewrites the staging area.

   Symptoms appear immediately: `git status` errors; `cat` of the file returns nulls; `git rev-parse HEAD` fails; `xxd .git/HEAD | head` shows trailing `00`s.

   Workaround (general pattern):
   ```bash
   # Write the broken file via the rm+write Python pattern (bash-side won't trust the host write).
   # Use the same Python rm+write block from quirk #1.

   # If `.git/objects/` is missing, create it manually:
   mkdir -p .git/objects/info .git/objects/pack

   # If `.git/index` is corrupt, rebuild it from HEAD:
   rm .git/index
   git read-tree HEAD

   # Verify:
   git status      # should now report a clean repo
   git rev-parse HEAD
   git fsck --full # should be silent / no errors
   ```

   Additional constraint: the host-side `Edit` and `Write` tools refuse `.git/` paths ("resolves to a protected location"). All `.git/` writes must go through bash via FUSE — which is the layer that breaks. The rm+write Python pattern is the only reliable path.


## Cowork environment quirks (operational hygiene)

The section above ("Cowork sandbox quirks") catalogues the underlying bugs. This section is the operational protocol that accumulated across the Phase C → tagging audit arc (May 2026). Hard rules; follow them before re-discovering each lesson.

### 1. The 16 KB tail-truncation rule (M1 §7.3)

When the `Edit` or `Write` tool produces a file larger than ~16 KB *post-edit*, the tail silently truncates. Pre-edit size doesn't matter; post-edit size does. Refines quirk #1 with the concrete boundary.

**Detection**: `wc -l` + `tail -3` after every edit on a file near the boundary; compare actual line count to expected delta.

**Recovery**: pull intact version from `git HEAD`, reassemble in `/tmp/`, `shutil.copy2` back to the live path, SHA-verify and re-grep anchors.

**Hard rule**: files at or past the boundary use anchor-based Python patches via heredoc, never direct `Edit`/`Write` tool calls. Confirmed sites past the boundary: `mediavault.html`, `yt_archive_capture.py`, `CHANGELOG.md`, all audit briefs, all multi-section run reports.

### 2. Virtiofs phantom-deletions in `git status`

When sandboxed bash runs `git status` against a mounted Windows repo, it frequently reports mass deletions (`D path1 path2 ...`) and `bad signature 0x00000000` errors. These are virtiofs-side view artifacts. The real files exist on disk; host git is fine. Specialised manifestation of quirk #6 (sandbox `git status` desync) + quirk #8 (FUSE-mangled git internals).

**Detection**: `ls` the "deleted" paths from sandbox — they exist. `git log` and `git show <hash>:<path>` work correctly. Host PowerShell `git status` is clean.

**Hard rule**: **Git commits run on host PowerShell only — for any virtiofs-mounted repo.** Sandbox can write the working tree; sandbox cannot safely stage or commit, because `.git/index.lock` writes succeed but `rm -f .git/index.lock` fails with "Operation not permitted" on virtiofs. Originally surfaced in HR; confirmed Museum and MV exhibit the same constraint (release-flow arc, 2026-05-28).

**Recovery prelude** for any host-side HR commit (always-safe, idempotent):

```powershell
if (Test-Path .git\index.lock) { Remove-Item .git\index.lock }
git reset --mixed HEAD
# then proceed with git add / git commit as usual
```

Recovers any HR index corruption that bled through from sandbox activity. Cheap; include in every host-paste block by default.

**First-sighting note**: rule and first confirmed sighting coincided. During the same hygiene-commit session (`af8e761`) that banked this rule, sandbox `git status --short` flagged `hunter_root.json` as a 1,929-line phantom delete while host `git status --short` returned clean.

### 3. Virtiofs COMMIT failure on SQLite writes (M1 §7.2 expanded)

SQLite `COMMIT` against a DB on a virtiofs-mounted path fails with "disk I/O error" / "database is locked" / silent corruption. Pattern is universal — any DB write that needs to COMMIT must run against a copy on the sandbox's native filesystem.

Working pattern (v0.5.6, v0.5.7, v0.5.8 sessions):

1. `shutil.copy2(live_db, '/tmp/<unique>.sqlite')`.
2. Open the `/tmp/` copy; do all writes; COMMIT there.
3. Independent re-verify on the `/tmp/` copy.
4. `shutil.copy2('/tmp/<unique>.sqlite', live_db)` — **not** `os.replace`, which fails cross-device on virtiofs mounts.
5. Final verify on the host DB from a fresh connection.

Step 4 is the trap: `os.replace` looks idiomatic for atomic rename, but virtiofs is a different device than `/tmp` and the rename errors out. `shutil.copy2` is the safe variant.

### 4. Cowork delete permission is per-session

`mcp__cowork__allow_cowork_file_delete` for `C:\AI` does NOT persist across sessions. Budget one re-grant call at GATE 2 time per session, or earlier if file deletion is needed mid-session (e.g. `.git/index.lock` cleanup). Refines quirk #3 with the "per-session" constraint.

### 5. Folder mounts are per-session too

Fresh Cowork sessions start with no mounts. Audit-on-entry must call `mcp__cowork__request_cowork_directory` for each repo the session needs (typically Museum + MV + HR) before any other work. The request is reliable and idempotent.

### 6. The release flow (cross-reference)

The 4-step release flow lives in `### Release flow` above (the one that ships MV's released artifacts to weird.baby). Step 2 (`npm run export-artifacts`) is the most-missed step; the `EXHIBIT_BACKFILL_DEPLOY` session traced the "released video didn't show up" symptom directly to skipping it. Re-read that section before any release-related work.

### 7. Audit-on-entry kickoff premises can be stale

Kickoff briefs reference file paths, function names, and existing-code states from the operator's memory of a session start that may be hours or days old. T3 (2026-05-25) hit four wrong anchors in one kickoff: server change "in mediavault.html" was actually in `core/imgserver.py`; `hr_dimensions.js` placement was misremembered by one directory; a heuristic flagged for retirement was already retired weeks earlier; the export tool location was named in the wrong repo.

**Hard rule**: map every kickoff anchor (file path, function name, "existing X" claim) to the actual codebase BEFORE drafting the design. Surface mismatches at GATE 3, not at patch time. The kickoff is a planning artifact; the codebase is ground truth.

### 8. Sandbox FUSE cache doesn't auto-invalidate on host writes

When the operator runs a host-side write mid-session (an export script, `npm install`, a Python script invoked from PowerShell), the sandbox's view of the rewritten files remains the pre-write stale version. Symptoms: sandbox `stat` shows old mtime, `wc -c` shows old size, `cat` returns old content, `git status` doesn't list the files. The Read tool (host-direct) shows fresh content. `drop_caches` requires root and is not available. No reliable sandbox-side invalidation exists.

**Hard rule**: when a host-side write occurs mid-session, assume the sandbox view is stale until cross-checked via the Read tool. If staging or commit comes next, hand off to host PowerShell (per §2). Generalises sandbox-quirk #6 beyond `git status` desync to any file content. Surfaced T3 (2026-05-25) on the museum-side JSON regen.

### 9. Build smoke is workerd-blocked in sandbox

`npm run build` cannot run in the cowork sandbox: rolldown and workerd both have Windows-installed binaries that don't work on Linux. Rolldown is fixable via the symlink in sandbox-quirk #5. Workerd would require `npm install @cloudflare/workerd-linux-64` which mutates node_modules too invasively for a verification check.

**Substitute smoke pattern for museum-side JS changes**:

1. `node --check <file>` — syntax.
2. `npx eslint <file>` — isolated lint.
3. Full-repo `npm run lint` baseline-diff — zero new errors.
4. If the change is a function/comparator, write an inline Node `--input-type=module` unit test with mocked dependencies.

Build itself runs on the operator's Windows side. Applied T3 (2026-05-25); all four steps cleared.

### 10. hunter_root.json regen can shrink the released set

`npm run export-artifacts` writes the *current* MV released set. If MV release-status flips have shrunk the set since the previous export (unrelease, retire, status correction), the new JSON will have fewer artifacts than the committed version. T3 session captured a 54 → 45 drop with no upstream change in scope. Two clarifications: re-derive the before-count from the prior `hunter_root.json` on disk — never trust a carried-forward count, which goes stale across sessions. And a legitimate down-regen (intended cleanup, retag, unrelease) still warrants an explicit acknowledgement at surfacing time; silence is the bug, not the shrink itself.

**Hard rule**: capture before/after artifact counts on every `export-artifacts` run. If after-count is less than before-count, surface to operator before committing — the shrink may be intended (cleanup) or a regression (accidental unrelease), and it isn't visible from the diff summary alone.

### 11. Sandbox cannot reach MV HTTP server

`npm run export-artifacts` hits `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:51822/db')` to read MV's released set. From the cowork bash sandbox, `127.0.0.1` is sandbox-local — not the Windows host. `host.docker.internal` DNS-fails; the default gateway (172.16.10.1:51822) times out. No working sandbox→host route to MV's HTTP server exists.

**Hard rule**: any flow that calls MV's HTTP server runs on host PowerShell, with MV launched first via `C:\AI\Platform\MediaVault\launch_mediavault.bat`. `export-artifacts` is the canonical case. Sandbox handles verification, build, and deploy; sandbox does NOT run `export-artifacts`. Surfaced release-flow run, 2026-05-28.

### 12. Virtiofs maps NTFS-illegal characters to PUA glyphs

Linux-created filenames containing NTFS-illegal characters (`: \ * ? " < > |`) appear on the Windows side with those characters mapped to U+F0xx private-use-area glyphs. PowerShell then parses the displayed glyph back as the original illegal character and tries to resolve it as a path component (e.g., `'.\C:\AI\...'` becomes a drive-letter attempt and fails).

**Hard rule**: address such files by substring wildcard, never literal name.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Force | Where-Object { $_.Name -like '*substr*' } | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
```

First sighting (release-flow run, 2026-05-28): a stray `C:\AI\Platform\MediaVault/`-named directory in the museum repo — a leaked path-string-as-folder from an earlier session. Resolved via the wildcard pattern above.

### 13. Run reports land on disk before the session's final commit

Every cowork session writes its run report to a known path on disk BEFORE that session's final commit (if any). The path goes into the next session's kickoff `§LOCKED_CONTEXT` so the report is recoverable.

**Why**: backfilling after commit means the commit's accompanying artifact is missing from the moment it lands. The hygiene-commit session (`af8e761`) backfilled successfully; the release-flow session's report apparently never landed in a locatable place at all — which forced this deferred-banking close-out session to exist. The very gap this rule addresses is the gap that created it.

**Hard rule**: for any cowork session that produces a commit, write the run report to disk first, name it into the operator's kickoff, then hand the commit text to the operator. Sessions that don't commit still write a report and name it into the carryforward.

## Things that are explicitly off-limits

- **`src/styles/museum-tokens.css`** — design tokens. Off-limits for population/data work; only touch with explicit UX direction.
- **Routing files** during data tasks — `Exhibit.jsx`, `HrExhibitFlow.jsx`, etc. are routing components. Population/data tasks should not modify them. UX tasks can.

## Pre-existing lint debt (4 errors)

These have been on `main` since before May 2026 and are deliberately untouched. Each needs semantic review, not a mechanical fix:

| Location | Rule | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `WbAdmin.jsx:18` | react-hooks setState-in-effect | Could be a real cascading-render bug. Effect intent needs review. |
| `Exhibit.jsx:88` | react-hooks/immutability (`schedule` accessed before declared in FactScroller useEffect) | Reordering surfaces 3 new errors at lines 127–128 (`Cannot access refs during render`). The deeper fix is wrapping those reads — structural, not a lint cleanup. |
| `Exhibit.jsx:191` | "Compilation Skipped: Existing memoization could not be preserved" | React Compiler can't see through `ensureApi(() => initPlayer(ytId))`. Restructure useCallback deps. |
| `Exhibit.jsx:508` | Same forward-reference pattern as :88, with `advanceQueue` (declared at line 577). Same cascade risk. Cleaner fix: `useCallback(() => advanceQueueRef.current(), [])` with a stale-closure ref. |

If asked to do "lint cleanup", these are the targets. Don't pretend they're trivial — read the surrounding code first.

## Recent session log

Maintained here. Newest first.

### 2026-05-30 → broken-preview fallback for gallery/artifact images
- `HrExhibitFlow.jsx` + `.css`: gallery/artifact images with a null/empty `src` or that 404/fail to load now degrade to a styled placeholder (muted INK/GOLD tile, artifact title + "image unavailable") instead of silent blankness — across the gallery card cover and the lightbox large image + thumb strip. Background-image surfaces (no native `onError`) detect failure via an out-of-band `Image()` probe hook (`useImageFailed`); the lightbox `<img>` uses native `onError` (`FallbackImg`, keyed on `src`). Display-only — no DB/sync/export touch. Addresses the HEIC-incident failure mode (assets fail by path OR format with no front-end signal).

### 2026-05-15 → tier reconciliation + navigation expansion
- `7f9843d` fix(deep-dive): trimmed `TIER_BY_NAMESPACE` in `hr_dimensions.js` to the canonical seven (`year/album/song/venue/people` at Tier 1; `source/type` at Tier 2). MV-residue namespaces fall to dynamic Tier 3 via the `?? 3` fallback. `CANONICAL_VOCABULARY.md` line 86 follow-up resolved.
- `386f69e` docs: NAVIGATION.md — added "Current state and what's next" section.

### 2026-05-14 → navigation + architecture critique (`5a89835`)
- Landed `NAVIGATION.md`, a Phase 2b architecture critique, and vocab migration scripts.

### 2026-05-13 → B-1 plan locked (`5558fb2`)
- B-1 implementation plan committed; seven operator decisions locked.

### 2026-05-12 → architectural recovery (`b1a632c`)
- `docs/CANONICAL_VOCABULARY.md` locked from v28_3 prototype; UX/data lifecycle specs and Q-5 follow-up note landed. Flags drift between `b29f9fe`'s `TIER_BY_NAMESPACE` heuristic and the new canonical doc (reconciled 2026-05-15 in `7f9843d`).

### 2026-05-11 → MV-driven artifacts + v4/v5 spec arc (PR #16, `b29f9fe`)
- `21cf558` docs: end-to-end workflow map (ground truth before architectural pivot).
- `649f006` docs: `SPEC_DRAFT_v4.md` — corrected architecture, supersedes v3.
- `669c7e7` docs: `SPEC_DRAFT_v5.md` — strict tag equality, Exhibitor's Badge, loud failures.
- `79159e3` docs: `SPEC_DRAFT_v5_1.md` — patch addressing v5 design review findings.
- `08299ee` docs: `SPEC_DRAFT_v5_2.md` — Q-1, Q-5, Q-6 resolved; Path B selected.
- `b29f9fe` feat(deep-dive): phase v5-3+v5-4 — MV-driven artifacts replace authored card data. Added `TIER_BY_NAMESPACE` heuristic with seven MV-residue namespaces (reconciled to canonical 2026-05-15 in `7f9843d`).

- `860ee05` feat(deep-dive): phase 3 export CLI — MV to museum bridge (PR #14). Added `tools/export-deep-tags.mjs`; later renamed to `tools/export-artifacts.mjs` with `npm run export-artifacts`.
- `8872ec0` fix(export-deep-tags): drop `archived_at` clause; add `prebuild-install` dev dep.
- `caf1b01` chore: add `.gitattributes` enforcing LF; renormalize existing files.

- Per-tab `✕` introduced; strip-level "clear all" removed
- `position: fixed` on deck (vs absolute-in-section) — pins to viewport bottom regardless of section centering
- Conditional 60px lift via `body:has(.pb)`
- AuditStrip render-call removed (function preserved)

- HrArchive `SINGLES` deduped (kept Chase The Dragon only)

## Conventions for updating this file

- Add new "Recent session log" entries at the top, dated and PR-linked.
- Update "Cowork sandbox quirks" when you hit something new.
- If you add a new piece of design vocabulary (a constant, a CSS variable, a behavior pattern), add it here so the next session doesn't reverse-engineer it.
- Don't let this file grow past ~600 lines. If it does, archive older session log entries to `docs/`.
