# Claude session notes

This file is for future Claude sessions on this repo. The human (Mike) doesn't read it. Keep it terse, practical, and up-to-date with anything that bit you.

If you're starting fresh: read this top-to-bottom before touching code. Then read `STATUS.md` and `docs/MUSEUM_UX.md` for current direction.

---

## What this repo is

Weird.Baby Museum — a Vite + React + React Router site, deployed via Cloudflare Workers. The frontend is a "museum" with multiple artists/sections. Hunter Root (HR) is the primary artist content currently built out.

The "exhibit" surface (album coverflow + tracklist + video player + filter deck) lives at `/hr` and is the most active area for UX work.

MediaVault is now under local-only git at `C:\AI\Platform\MediaVault\.git` (initialized 2026-05-08). Three commits as of init, branch `master`, no remote ever planned. See MediaVault's `STATE.md` "Version control" section and `CHANGELOG.md` for current state.

### Data model — albums and tracks

Three parallel representations of the same data. Mike calls these "variants" (which is overloaded with the music-variant taxonomy below — context disambiguates).

1. **`SPINE` in `src/data/artists/hunter-root.js`** — canonical. Each album: `{ id, title, year, art, accent, tracks: [{ title, videos: [{ ytId, label, type, credit? }] }] }`.
2. **`ALBUMS` in `src/routes/hr/HrArchive.jsx`** — title-only mirror. `tracks: ["Title 1", "Title 2", ...]`.
3. **`HR_ALBUM_OPTIONS` and `HR_SONG_OPTIONS` in `src/routes/hr/hr_dimensions.js`** — slug/label vocabulary for filter pills.

When you change the spine, mirror the change in #2 and verify #3 still covers all unique track titles. `hr_facts.js` references tracks by exact `albumId` + `trackId` (== `title`) — don't rename a title without checking facts.

### Track media variant taxonomy

Per Mike (settled May 2026): variants are **Official / Live / Lyrics / Cover**. **Clips don't belong in tracklists** — drop them, don't tag them. The `type` field on each video is one of `"official" | "live" | "lyrics" | "cover"`.

There used to be `"clip"` entries; they're gone as of merge `e4ea01b`.

## Design tokens

Single canonical gold across the codebase. JS constants in `HrExhibitFlow.jsx`:

| Constant | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `INK` | `#080808` | Section background |
| `INK_SOFT` | `#0d0d0d` | Active tab / pill fill, "raised card" |
| `INK_CARD`, `INK_CARD_HI` | `#0a0a0a`, `#0e0e0e` | Card backgrounds |
| `BORDER` | `#1a1a1a` | Pill default border |
| `BORDER_HI` | `#252525` | Zero-count pill text |
| `GOLD` / `GOLD_HI` / `GOLD_LO` / `DIM` | all `#b8974a` | Canonical gold (consolidated; comments preserve the cream-→-gold history) |
| `GOLD_MUTE` | `#555` | Disabled / muted controls |

Inline-styled "less bright gold" values: `#6a5520` (deck pill unselected), `#7a7a7a` (tracklist tag unselected). When in doubt, prefer one of these instead of inventing new shades.

## Exhibit deck — non-obvious behaviors

These are the cumulative result of the May-2026 UX iterations. Reading the JSX without this context will mislead.

- **Tab strip is `position: fixed`** (in `S.deck`), not absolute-in-section. It pins to the viewport bottom, not to `.hr-section-deck-host`. This is to escape `.hr-section`'s `scroll-snap-align: center` which centers the section with a 32px gap above/below.
- **Player bar lift** is conditional via CSS `body:has(.pb) .hr-deck { bottom: 60px; }`. The default is `bottom: 0`. PlayerBar (Exhibit.jsx) returns null when no video plays, so `.pb` leaves the DOM and the deck slides back down.
- **Active tab merges with deck-body** via a 1px-tall `INK_SOFT` cover element (positioned `left:-1, right:-1, bottom:-1` inside the active tab when `open && active`) that overlays the deck-body's `border-top: 1px solid var(--hr-gold-lo)`.
- **`TAB_PEEK = TAB_STRIP_H = 30`** — the closed and hover-peek states render identically. Originally `TAB_PEEK=14` for a "tab tops only" peek effect, but at 30px tab height the labels get clipped mid-glyph. Pinned to full strip.
- **Pill semantics**: a column with **zero selections** is treated as "all selected" (no filter). Pills render in `GOLD_HI` with **transparent border**. Selecting any one pill flips the others to dim+border to indicate an explicit filter. This is the `noneSelected` prop threaded `PillGroupColumn → PillButton → S.pill / S.pillCount`.
- **Pill count color matches label color** in every state. Don't break this.
- **Tracklist variants are radio buttons** — only one variant active per track. Click an active variant to deselect to empty. (Was multi-select Set semantics pre-`f01ee88`.)
- **Per-tab clear `✕`** — small `✕` in each tab's top-right corner. Always rendered. Dim+unclickable when `tabHasSelection(tab)` is false; brighter+pointer when true. The strip-level "clear all" button no longer exists. The original `clear()` whole-deck reset is preserved with `eslint-disable-next-line` comment for potential revival.
- **AuditStrip is dev-only and intentionally not rendered** — was at z-index 9999 bottom-right and occluded the player bar's controls. The function is preserved in `HrExhibitFlow.jsx` for revival; the JSX render call is removed.

## Workflow

Mike develops on Windows; you usually run inside a Cowork Linux sandbox. The split:

- **You make edits + commits in the cowork sandbox.** Files write to disk via the FUSE mount → Mike's actual repo.
- **Mike pushes from PowerShell.** You can't push from the sandbox (no GitHub credentials).
- **You drive Chrome to open the PR.** Mike has the GitHub tab open; you navigate, fill the title and body, click Create, then Squash and merge, Confirm, Delete branch.
- **Mike runs the local cleanup** (checkout main, pull, branch -d).

Mike pre-approves the entire flow when he says "push" — drive end-to-end without re-asking for each click.

### Conventions

- **Branch naming**: hyphenated (e.g. `ux-exhibit-tweaks-2`). **Slashed names like `ux/foo` fail in the cowork sandbox** — the FUSE mount can't create subdirectories under `.git/refs/heads/`. Always use hyphens.
- **Commit author from cowork**: `cowork agent <cowork@local>`. GitHub overrides this on squash-merge to Mike's noreply (`98126530+langmikea@users.noreply.github.com`), so the squash commit on `main` is correctly authored.
- **Commit messages**: subject line under 72 chars, imperative mood. Body explains *why* and references the user's report verbatim where applicable.
- **PR bodies**: tabular fix summary, commit list, mechanism notes, "out of scope" section. Include the literal user-reported phrasing.
- **Squash merge** is the default — most branches accumulate iteration commits. Only choose merge-commit if the per-commit history is genuinely worth preserving.

### Pre-flight before commit

1. Verify file integrity: `wc -c <file>` matches expected, `tail -3 <file>` shows the proper end.
2. `npm run lint` — should be at the baseline (currently **4 errors / 6 warnings**, all pre-existing on main, all in routing files Mike has flagged for separate semantic review). If your number is higher, you've introduced an error.
3. `npm run build` — must pass. Vite + rolldown + Cloudflare plugin.

## Local tooling

`tools/Get-ProjectStatus.ps1` is a PowerShell helper that reads the current repo state and prints a recommended next step — git branch/ahead/behind/uncommitted counts, the next unchecked task in `STATUS.md`/`TODO.md`/`NEXT.md` if present, detected manifests (Node, Python, etc.), and the five most recently modified files. Run it from the repo root: `.\tools\Get-ProjectStatus.ps1`. On a fresh Windows clone the script may be flagged as downloaded-from-web by SmartScreen — run `Unblock-File .\tools\Get-ProjectStatus.ps1` once to clear the zone-identifier ADS, then it executes normally.

### Deep Dive export

`npm run export-deep-tags` reads released YouTube artifacts from MediaVault (`http://127.0.0.1:51822/db`), extracts Deep Dive tags (`deep:<group>:<tag>`) and their associated `card_id` from `notes`, and writes the result to `src/data/deep-tags.json`. The museum imports this file statically at build time. MV must be running on the operator's laptop; the script won't work from CI or another machine.

Use `--dry-run` to see what would be exported without writing. Use `--verbose` to see the SQL query and per-card details.

### Cross-platform native dependencies

Any npm package with a native compiled component (currently `better-sqlite3`) requires `prebuild-install` in `devDependencies` so the operator's machine can fetch pre-built binaries on install without needing Visual Studio Build Tools. The cowork sandbox builds for Linux; Mike's Windows machine needs its own platform-specific binary. If a "not a valid Win32 application" error appears at runtime on Windows, `npm rebuild <package-name>` is the local fix on the operator's side.

## Cowork sandbox quirks (READ THIS)

The FUSE mount has multiple defects that cost real time. Work around them:

1. **`Edit` tool truncates files.** When you call Edit on an existing file, the FUSE mount preserves the original byte count and pads/truncates. If your edit makes the file longer, content from the end gets clipped. **Mitigation**: always `tail -3` and `wc -c` after an Edit. For non-trivial edits, use a Python `rm + write` pattern via `mcp__workspace__bash`:
   ```python
   with open(path, 'rb') as f: data = f.read()
   data = data.replace(old, new, 1)
   os.remove(path)
   with open(path, 'wb') as f: f.write(data)
   ```

   Related manifestation: bash views of files in the FUSE mount may show truncated content even when the `Read` tool sees full content for the same path — the host-side (Windows) file is usually intact, the bash view is the unreliable one. When pre-flighting (`wc -c`, `tail -3`) the file looks wrong via bash, cross-check via the `Read` tool before assuming the file on disk is broken. Verified at PR #14 (Phase 3 session, 2026-05-10): `CLAUDE.md` read fine via Read but bash `tail -3` cut off mid-word; on-disk content was intact. When this hits, don't read-modify-write via Python — construct fresh content from the Read-tool view and write-only via the rm+write pattern.

2. **CRLF line endings.** Files on Windows disk are CRLF; the FUSE mount preserves them. `sed` and Python regex matching needs to handle both LF and CRLF. Pattern:
   ```python
   if old_b in data: data = data.replace(old_b, new_b)
   elif old_b.replace(b'\n', b'\r\n') in data: data = data.replace(...)
   ```

3. **`rm` requires explicit permission**. First call `mcp__cowork__allow_cowork_file_delete(path)` once per session — Mike approves a directory and then deletes work for the rest of the session. Without it, `rm`, `git stash`, `git checkout -b` (any op that creates and removes lock files) fail with "Operation not permitted". Scope the request narrowly the first time. Asking for delete permission on a whole project tree (e.g. `MediaVault/`) will be rejected; asking for the specific subdirectory the work needs (e.g. `MediaVault/.git/`) will be approved. State explicitly in the request that no user files will be touched. Re-requesting after a rejection wastes a round trip.

4. **Slashed branch names fail** (see above). The sandbox can't `mkdir` under `.git/refs/heads/`.

5. **Build needs a manual symlink.** The rolldown native binary is nested wrong for Linux. The lookup path is `node_modules/rolldown/dist/rolldown-binding.linux-x64-gnu.node` (one directory level deeper than `node_modules/rolldown/`):
   ```bash
   ln -sf ../../@rolldown/binding-linux-x64-gnu/rolldown-binding.linux-x64-gnu.node \
     node_modules/rolldown/dist/rolldown-binding.linux-x64-gnu.node
   ```
   Run this before `npm run build` if you're getting `Cannot find module '../rolldown-binding.linux-x64-gnu.node'`. The symlink is gitignored and harmless on Mike's Windows side. Verified at PR #14 (Phase 3 session, 2026-05-10) — earlier path documentation was off by one directory level.

6. **Sandbox `git status` can desync after heavy activity.** If you see "No commits yet" or every file as "new", the sandbox view is broken — Mike's actual git state on disk is fine. Verify by asking Mike to run `git status` in PowerShell, or by using the `Read` tool (which reads the Windows path directly, separate from the FUSE git view).

7. **CRLF false positives in `git status`.** On a freshly-mounted repo, `git status` may show every routing-file CSS/JSX as `M` due to CRLF round-tripping through FUSE. Verify with `git diff --ignore-cr-at-eol --stat`; if empty, it's noise — proceed with explicit `git add` paths to keep the noise out of your commit.

8. **FUSE mangles git's internal files — multiple symptoms across multiple triggers.** Originally discovered 2026-05-08 during MediaVault `git init`; further manifestations surfaced at PR #14 (2026-05-10) during normal session work. The common root cause is the same as quirk #1 (FUSE byte-preservation / truncation), but applied to git's atomic `.lock`-rename writes rather than the Edit tool. The trigger is not only `git init` — it can fire on session mount and on any git operation that rewrites internal files atomically (`git stash`, branch ops, etc.).

   Known manifestations:
   - **`.git/config` written as null bytes** (54 bytes of `\x00`) from bash's view on a fresh `git init`, while the host-side filesystem shows partial valid content. Fix: rewrite `.git/config` via the rm+write Python pattern from quirk #1.
   - **`.git/objects/` missing entirely** after `git init`. Without it, `git status` reports "not a git repository." Subdirectories `info/` and `pack/` are also missing. Fix: `mkdir -p .git/objects/info .git/objects/pack`.
   - **`.git/HEAD` arriving with trailing null bytes on session mount** (e.g. 34 bytes instead of 21, with `\x00` padding after `ref: refs/heads/main\n`). Symptom: `git rev-parse HEAD` errors with "Failed to resolve HEAD as a valid ref" / "ambiguous argument 'HEAD'"; `git status` may also error. Fix: rm+write Python pattern with a clean `ref: refs/heads/main\n` (21 bytes).
   - **`.git/index` corrupted by `git stash` (or other atomic-rewrite ops)**. Symptom: "bad signature 0x00000000" or "index file corrupt". Fix: `rm .git/index && git read-tree HEAD` to rebuild the index from the committed tree. No working-tree changes are lost — `git read-tree HEAD` only rewrites the staging area.

   Symptoms appear immediately: `git status` errors; `cat` of the file returns nulls; `git rev-parse HEAD` fails; `xxd .git/HEAD | head` shows trailing `00`s.

   Workaround (general pattern):
   ```bash
   # Write the broken file via the rm+write Python pattern (bash-side won't trust the host write).
   # Use the same Python rm+write block from quirk #1.

   # If `.git/objects/` is missing, create it manually:
   mkdir -p .git/objects/info .git/objects/pack

   # If `.git/index` is corrupt, rebuild it from HEAD:
   rm .git/index
   git read-tree HEAD

   # Verify:
   git status      # should now report a clean repo
   git rev-parse HEAD
   git fsck --full # should be silent / no errors
   ```

   Additional constraint: the host-side `Edit` and `Write` tools refuse `.git/` paths ("resolves to a protected location"). All `.git/` writes must go through bash via FUSE — which is the layer that breaks. The rm+write Python pattern is the only reliable path.

## Things that are explicitly off-limits

- **`STATUS.md`** — Mike maintains this manually. Don't touch.
- **`src/styles/museum-tokens.css`** — design tokens. Off-limits for population/data work; only touch with explicit UX direction.
- **Routing files** during data tasks — `Exhibit.jsx`, `HrExhibitFlow.jsx`, etc. are routing components. Population/data tasks should not modify them. UX tasks can.

## Pre-existing lint debt (4 errors)

These have been on `main` since before May 2026 and are deliberately untouched. Each needs semantic review, not a mechanical fix:

| Location | Rule | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `WbAdmin.jsx:18` | react-hooks setState-in-effect | Could be a real cascading-render bug. Effect intent needs review. |
| `Exhibit.jsx:88` | react-hooks/immutability (`schedule` accessed before declared in FactScroller useEffect) | Reordering surfaces 3 new errors at lines 127–128 (`Cannot access refs during render`). The deeper fix is wrapping those reads — structural, not a lint cleanup. |
| `Exhibit.jsx:191` | "Compilation Skipped: Existing memoization could not be preserved" | React Compiler can't see through `ensureApi(() => initPlayer(ytId))`. Restructure useCallback deps. |
| `Exhibit.jsx:508` | Same forward-reference pattern as :88, with `advanceQueue` (declared at line 577). Same cascade risk. Cleaner fix: `useCallback(() => advanceQueueRef.current(), [])` with a stale-closure ref. |

If asked to do "lint cleanup", these are the targets. Don't pretend they're trivial — read the surrounding code first.

## Conventions for updating this file

- Add new "Recent session log" entries at the top, dated and PR-linked.
- Update "Cowork sandbox quirks" when you hit something new.
- If you add a new piece of design vocabulary (a constant, a CSS variable, a behavior pattern), add it here so the next session doesn't reverse-engineer it.
- Don't let this file grow past ~600 lines. If it does, archive older session log entries to `docs/`.
